       A simple bit array (or bit set, bit string, boolean vector, ... whatever) data structure for Lua written in pure C.
        * Array bit access using overloaded `[]` operators, concatenation with `..`, as well as `&, |, ~` for bit operations (5.3+).
        * Object-oriented access. Method chaining is available.
        * Conversion between bitarray and unsigned integers (big-endian).
